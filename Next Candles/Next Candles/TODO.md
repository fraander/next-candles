- [ ] Bug fix: Birthday on March 11 produced notification on midnight March 10th saying "Birthday Alert! User Name's birthday is on 3/10, which is 1 day away." Which is incorrect because it is not their birthday yet. Message should read: "Birthday Alert! User Name's birthday is on 3/11, which is 1 day away."
- [ ] Bug fix: when a phone nunber changed, the phone numbers diff arenâ€™t quite right (no phone numbers were shown even though the title was shown) Possibly has something to do with adding an international code to the start
